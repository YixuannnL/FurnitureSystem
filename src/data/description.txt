"This sideboard is designed for dining room use, focusing on substantial storage and stability. It measures 1600mm in length, 800mm in height, and 450mm in depth, featuring both drawers and cabinets.

The sideboard includes three felt-lined drawers, each 486mm wide and 150mm high, positioned side-by-side in the upper section. The felt lining protects silverware and serving utensils from scratches and damage. Each drawer is equipped with a handle for easy opening.

Below the drawers are two cabinets, each with double doors and adjustable shelves. The cabinet interiors are divided into two sections by a central vertical panel, with each section being 773mm wide. Each cabinet is equipped with two adjustable shelves, allowing for flexible storage configurations for dishes and glassware of various sizes. The doors are solid, concealing the contents and providing a neat appearance. Each door has a handle for easy access.

The sideboard rests on a base consisting of four vertical support panels, one at each corner, providing stability. The bottom edge of the vertical support panels is equipped with adjustable feet to ensure levelness on slightly uneven floors. The base is integrated into the overall structure to provide a solid and stable foundation for the entire sideboard.

The back panel of the sideboard is a single continuous panel, enhancing the overall structural integrity and preventing items from falling out the back.
This design provides a blend of specialized and general storage, ensuring the sideboard is both functional and aesthetically pleasing while maintaining stability and levelness."
